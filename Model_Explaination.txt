This prediction of fraud data was based on model 1 provided in the report 
which is based on the random forest classifier 
The feature selection is based on the function in python called RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination
with Cross Validation) which I have assigned for it another random forest classifier to select the important features 
based on the f score of each model
I applied a random search algorithm to find out the optimum hyper parameters which gives me the best f score.

This model gives me the highest the f score among the proposed three models 
Moreover, It has had a reasnable execution time on the 500 K dataset
In addition, This classifier is not affected b the problem of imbalanced dataset

for predicitng the class of the transactions in the test.csv , I have loaded the file in python, then retrieve the model that has
the optimum hyper parameter based on highest f score.
Then apply the pre processing steps on the test dataset.
After that, apply the predict function provided by python to predict the value of isFraud column.
