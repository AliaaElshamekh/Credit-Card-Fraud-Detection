In this project, I have used three different models for classification task along with a lot of preprocessing steps to prepare the data for mining processes. The first model is based on a random forest classifier which results were good enough with f- score 0.59. The second model is based on Adaboost classifier with /without base estimator which gives a f- score near 0.5 but has so long execution time. The last model I proposed in the project is a bagging classifier based on KNN as a base estimator which results were the lowest. The hyper parameter tuning of all these models was based on random search algorithm to find out the optimum parameters for the models proposed here
